                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am someone who has been passionate about <strong>video games</strong> since my earliest memory in 2002 when I used to play
                    on the Nintendo 64 at just 4 years old. Video games have remained my greatest passion and I have never stopped playing them.
                    In high school, I discovered that I had a gift for understanding <strong>mathematical concepts</strong> and <strong>solving problems</strong>, which led to it
                    becoming my favorite subject alongside natural science.

                    At University, I pursued a <strong>degree in Physics and Mathematics</strong>, but I eventually realized that my true passion lay in writing
                    code. This discovery reignited my love for gaming and motivated me to make a change. So, I made the bold decision to leave
                    University earlier than planned and enroll in Algonquin College to pursue a career in <strong>software engineering</strong>. My <strong>ultimate goal</strong>
                    is to design and code my own video games, something that combines my passion for gaming and my love of coding.
